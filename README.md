## Logo / Art direction for DÃ©part de Sentier

#### From the designer

It's a topographic map, it can remind wood too. 
I cropped the pattern to something balanced. 
If you look closely you can see the D and the S (initials of DÃ©part de Sentier) in the lines, at the beginning I wanted to show this a bit more with dotted lines, but it was a bit too much in my opinion.
I prefered to keep the logo simple. 
The shades of green represent the forest and nature of course, and to accentuate the technical and scientific skills, I chose darker and a bit desaturated palette.
It creates a more professional look. ~~I also added a baseline because your name is a little unconventional. We can modify it or remove it if you think it's unecessary.~~ (removed)

A word on the typography, i wanted a rounded typeface (but not too much) for the warm and human side, the larger x-height gives an open readability even in small sizes, in full caps it brings some stability.
